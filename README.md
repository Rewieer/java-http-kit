# java-http-client

This is my own implementation of an HttpClient and HttpServer doing basic stuff for training purpose, into
having a better understanding of Java SDK, sockets, threads, and HTTP Protocol.

#Â Tasks

* Allow to programmatically stop the server without stopping the program
* Limit the number of simultaneous TCP connections
* Allow understanding for even more complex Requests
* Handle custom routing algorithms
* Allow HttpClient to work as an HTTP proxy
* Make the proxy stores data about requests on a database
* Handle caching by using Last-Modified headers and stuff
